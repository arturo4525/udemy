# What does Encapsulation mean?

In java, it means to hide things by making them private, or inaccessible.

- This is used to make the interface simpler and hide unnecessary details.
- To protect the integrity of data on an object, to hide or restrict access to some of the data and operations.
- To decouple the published interface from the internal details of the class, we may hid actual names and types of class members.


We protect the member of the class, and some methods, from external access.
This prevents calling code from bypassing the rules and constraints, we've built into the class.
When a new instance is created, its initialized with valid data.
But also, i'm making sure that there's no direct access to the fields.

Get used to encapsulation and try to work with that.


To create an Encapsulated class you want to:
Create constructors for object initialization, which enforces that only objects with valid data will get created.
Use the private access modifier, sparingly and only as needed.
Use setters and getters sparingly and only as needed.
Use access modifiers that aren't private, only for the methods that the calling code needs to use.
