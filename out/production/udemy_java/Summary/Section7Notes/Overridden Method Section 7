# The overridden method can do one of three things:
1. It can implement completely different behavior, overriding the behavior of the parent.
2. It can simply call the parent class's method, which is somewhat redundant to do.
3. Or the method can call the parent class's method, and include other code to run, so it can extend the functionality for the dog, for that specific behavior.
