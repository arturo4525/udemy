*** Javas Code Units ***

# Writing code is similar to writing a document. It consists of special hierarchical units, which together form a whole.
These are the expressions:
* The Expression - An expression computes to a single value.
* The Statement - Statements are stand alone units of work.
And code blocks - A code block is a set of zero, one , or more statements, usually grouped together in some way to achieve a single goal.

*** Whitespace ***
# never write several blocks of code / statements in one line, since it need to be readable and easy to understand to whomever.

*** Duplicated code ***

# // Without declaring them as new variables, code is runnable and uses the memory more efficiently.
 // However by doing this ur re-using code, if u need to change in one section. ALl codeblocks must be changed using the duplicated code.


 *** The Benefits of the Method ****

/* A Method is a way of reducing code duplication.
A method can be executed many times with potentially different results, by passing data to the method in the form of arguments.
*/

*** Executing a Method with parameters ***

To execute a method that's defined with parameters, you have to pass variables, values, or expressions that match the type,
order and number of the parameters declared.

In the calculateScore example, we declared the method with four parameters, the first a boolean, and the other three of int data types.
So we have to pass first a boolean, and then 3 int values as shown in this statements:

calculateScore (true, 800, 5, 100);
We can't pass the boolean type in any place, other than as the first argument, without an error.

The statement below would cause an error as well.
calculateScore  (800, 5, 100, true);
And there's no possibility to pass only a partial set of parameters as shown here:
calculateScore (true, 800);
