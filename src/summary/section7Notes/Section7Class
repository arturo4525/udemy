**** CLASS ****

Classes can be organized into logical grouping, which are called packages.
You declare a package name in the class using the package statement.
If you don't declare a package, the class implicitly belongs to the default package.

Public means any other class in any package can access this class.
When the modifier i omitted, this has a special meaning, called package access, meaning the class is accessible only to
classes in the same package.

What are getters and setters? Why should we use them?

A getter is a method on a class, that retrieves the value of a private field, and returns it.
A setter is a method ona a class, that sets the value of a private field.

The purpose of these methods is to control, and protect, access to private fields.


*** This ***

This is a special keyword in java. What it really refers to is the instance that was created when the object was instantiated.
So this is a special reference name of the object or instance, which it can use to describe itself.
And we can use "this" to access fields on the class.
