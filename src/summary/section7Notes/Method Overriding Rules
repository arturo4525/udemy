# There's also some important points about method overriding to keep in mind.

* Only inherited methods can be overridden, in other words, methods can be overridden only in child classes.
* Constructors and private methods cannot be overridden.
* Methods that are final cannot be overridden
* A subclass can use super.methodName() to call the superclass version of an overridden method.
